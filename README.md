# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis: Uncovering the Patterns Behind Loyalty Loss

## 🧠 Project Overview

In the past few years, the telecommunication industry has faced one of its toughest challenges — **customer retention**.  
According to [GSMA Intelligence (2023)](https://www.gsmaintelligence.com/research/the-mobile-churn-challenge-where-loyalty-is-lowest-and-four-recommendations-for-operators), *1 in 7 users switched providers within 12 months*, revealing how fragile customer loyalty has become.

This project explores the **behavioral**, **technical**, and **engagement factors** that drive customer churn, using the *Iranian Churn Dataset (UCI Repository)*.  
It combines data exploration, visualization, and business storytelling to answer three key questions:

1️⃣ Why do customers leave?  
2️⃣ Who is most at risk?  
3️⃣ What can we do to prevent it?

## 🧩 Objectives

- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify the key drivers of churn.  
- Translate data findings into **business insights** that can guide customer retention strategies.  
- Build a foundation for a **predictive churn model** to detect at-risk customers early.
